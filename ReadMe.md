Invoice
--------

I'm boring to write invoice.

I don't use even Word.

Oh, Let's use **AsciiDoc** to write inovice.

## Environment

- Windows10 Pro x64
    - PowerShell v5.1
- Visual Studio Code
    - AsciiDoc Extensions
- Git-Bash
    - include Git

## invoice data

- csv
- utf8
- data.csv

I want to calculate subtotal and sum to use Shell or PowerShell.

Linux/Mac can use shellscript include awk and sed.

Windows10 can use PowerShell.

calc.sh or calc.ps1 make **result.csv** form data.csv

## Stamp

In Japan, we use stamp.

So, I prepaired stamp.jpg file.

## How to use

1. Write into data.csv
2. Run calc.sh or calc.ps1 to calculate subtotal and sum.
3. Write invoice.adoc
4. Convert to pdf to use asciidoctor-pdf
